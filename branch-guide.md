# BRANCH GUIDE

Following are the most important branches:

- `main`: Contains the latest code, **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against `main` branch to be
  considered**.

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not do any PR to them!

Thanks!
